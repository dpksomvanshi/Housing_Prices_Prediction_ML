# Housing_Prices_Prediction_ML
The goal of this Project is to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 
I have uploaded Jupyter notebook and csv file of predicted housing prices.
Following Algorithms used for ML:
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
